Always generate docstrings in the format of Formal Documentation, in the language of portuguese (Brazil). 
Do not use a tecnical language, use a simple language that is easy to understand, but stil very formal. 
DonÂ´t write parts os the code, only explain then. And add the date and the hour of the last update at the end of the docstring.
